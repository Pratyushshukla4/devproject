    Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change. pollution can take the form of chemical substances or enerfy , such as boise , heat , ligt.
    The components of pollution can be either foreign subtances/energies or naturally occuring contaminants.

    Though air is a renewable resourse clean air is becoming increasingly scare because of air pollution.Air pollution is the contamination of air by undesirable particles and gases known as air pollutions. Car emissions, chemicals from factories, dust, pollen and mold spores may be suspended as particles. Ozone, a gas, is a major part of air pollution in cities.

        Carbon mooxide is produced as a result of the incomplete burning of fules, it reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide (CO2). However when there is insufficient oxygen,carbon monoxide (CO) is formed.Carbon moxide is a toxic gas. It binds with haemoglobin in blood and prevents it from carring oxygen.

        Sulfur dioxide is the chemical compound with the formula SO 2. It is a toxic gas responsible for the smell of burnt matches. It is released naturally by volcanic activity and is produced as a by-product of copper extraction and the burning of fossil fuels contaminated with sulfur compounds

       Pesticides are substances used for destroying insects or other organisms which are harmful for cultivated plants. Pesticides include a large group of chemical agents that attempt to eliminate destructive biological forces in agriculture. In this way pesticides causes Land pollution

        The incorrect way of chemical waste disposal from different types of industries causes the contamination of land. Human activities like this have led to acidification of soil and contamination due to the disposal of industrial waste, heavy metals, toxic chemicals, dumping oil and fuel, etc

        Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human activities. Water bodies include for example lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers and groundwater. Water pollution results when contaminants are introduced into the natural environment.

        Industrial and agricultural work involves the use of many different chemicals that can run-off into water and pollute it. Metals and solvents from industrial work can pollute rivers and lakes. Run-offs of these pesticides can cause water pollution and poison aquatic life.

        Humans, animals and plants all need unpolluted water to survive. Litter can also clog storm-water drains and cause flooding. Food scraps and other organic items that are disposed of improperly can increase algal blooms in water, which reduces the amount of available oxygen for other aquatic life. such as fish.
